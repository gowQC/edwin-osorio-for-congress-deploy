As your representative, I believe that our cooperative actions must always be predicated on human empathy and the unwavering respect and commitment to preserving the dignity of the valued American worker. By applying reasonable, responsible governance and unleashing the innovative spirit of our citizenry—always with the well-being of every family at heart—we can ensure New York and America remain second to none.",

    blurb:
      "We stand at a pivotal moment in our nation’s history. The staggering national debt now exceeding $36.2 trillion and standing at over 121% of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a silent mortgage on our children’s future—a bill run up on a credit card, passed on to the next generation without their consent. Our current fiscal path marked by a projected $1.9 trillion deficit in 2025 is unsustainable, risking the very American Dream we promise to pass down. It’s time for a bold, generational solution that tackles our debt, secures our social safety nets, and unleashes true economic opportunity for all. My platform proposes a prudent and powerful step: A targeted 2% national sales tax on consumption, strategically designed to strengthen our nation’s fiscal health and economic engine.",

    blurb:
      "In the New York 2nd Congressional District, we face an undeniable truth in our healthcare system: we are paying for a Rolls-Royce, but only getting a Cadillac in return. This is unacceptable. It is an affront to the very idea of American Exceptionalism. If other industrialized nations can achieve superior outcomes for less money, it is not merely an aspiration, but our solemn duty to surpass them. That is the true definition of American Exceptionalism. My platform is built on principles of value, transparency, and a relentless commitment to the dignity of hard work, ensuring that every Long Islander and every American has the opportunity to thrive. We will deliver the best for our people because that is what American Exceptionalism truly demands.",

    blurb:
      "For generations, the bedrock of the American Dream has been the dignity of honest work. Our tax code should reflect and champion this fundamental truth: the value of an individual’s labor is paramount. Yet, many hard-working Americans observe a stark and often unfair contrast in how different forms of income are treated by our tax system. We see income derived from the labor of an individual–from weekly paychecks to the pensions and Social Security benefits earned over decades of contribution–often taxed more heavily than income generated by money itself, whether through investments or financial instruments like carried interest. This disparity sends the wrong message, implicitly diminishing the very work ethic that built our nation.",

We are a nation built on innovation and success, and to continue leading, we must ensure our economic bedrock is as strong as our ambition. That means fostering an environment where growth is dynamic, opportunities abound, and the systems that underpin our success are robust and sustainable. Moreover, this plan benefits those who need us the most: our seniors in the twilight of their days and the young adults just beginning their journeys into the workforce. ",

    blurb:
      "The American middle class did not rise by accident—it was built by Unions. In the postwar decades when Union density was high, so was shared prosperity. Unions secured not just wages, but retirement security, health coverage, vacation time, and protection against arbitrary discipline. They empowered the working class to participate in America’s prosperity on fair terms. As Union influence declined, so too did the stability of the middle class. Wage growth slowed, benefits shrank, and the wealth gap exploded. The data is clear: Union strength correlates directly with middle-class health. The more organized labor we have, the more shared prosperity we enjoy.",

We deserve a government that works smarter, not just harder, and a government that makes every taxpayer dollar count. That’s why as your representative in Congress, I will champion the creation of a truly groundbreaking and permanent institution: the Legislative Department of Government Efficiency (L-DGE). This isn’t just another layer of bureaucracy; it’s a fundamental reimagining of how we ensure our government delivers for you. Just as the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) provides independent, objective analysis of our nation’s finances, the L-DGE will provide rigorous analysis of government operations, identifying waste, streamlining processes, and ensuring taxpayer dollars are spent effectively.",

This system is outdated, inefficient, and fundamentally at odds with the principles of American prudence and dynamism.

We are a nation that has always met grand challenges head-on, proving that what others achieve, we can not only accomplish but exceed.

I believe in American Exceptionalism—not as a slogan, but as a commitment: that our country can and must lead the world in opportunity, innovation, and justice.

      "We accept that states like New York and California send billions more to the federal government than they receive. These states are “donor states” in our federal system—supporting infrastructure, social programs, and economic security in states that receive far more than they contribute. And yet, we rarely question this dynamic. It is treated as an administrative fact, a neutral budgetary function, free from controversy. However, when we propose adjusting the Social Security payroll tax cap, or ask the wealthiest Americans to pay a higher share to support national programs, the conversation becomes heated, emotional, and highly personal. Now we are no longer speaking in abstractions. We are naming contributors—identifiable individuals—and asking them to give more. The resistance isn’t about math. It’s about the visibility of the giver and the recipient.",

That is why I believe we must run our campaigns and govern our institutions with no fear of losing. Because when we lose, but the process is fair, it means democracy has won. That is not a defeat. That is a win for the system we swear to serve. But when vast wealth drowns out working voices; when entire communities feel unseen; when policies are crafted for political advantage instead of human need, that is when democracy begins to die.",

American Exceptionalism isn’t inherited—it’s built generation by generation. Our Republic faces a critical challenge: ensuring every citizen is an active, informed participant in our democracy. This isn’t just about casting a vote; it’s about understanding how power works, how to influence it with purpose, and how to safeguard our shared future. We need to cultivate an engaged electorate from adolescence onward, building their resistance to manipulation and reclaiming American democracy as an accessible birthright for every generation.

    blurb:
      "For generations a fundamental debate has shaped our nation: what is the true role and capacity of government? We have heard the powerful sentiment, perhaps best encapsulated by Ronald Reagan’s famous words, that “the nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I’m from the government, and I’m here to help.” This perspective, often rooted in frustrating experiences with inefficiency and bureaucracy, suggests that government itself is the root of our challenges. My platform offers a different truth: it is not government that is inherently ineffective or inefficient, but rather the policies that become rigid and the people within government who fail to adapt or execute with vision. When we witness failures, it is often a symptom of outdated approaches and a lack of the right expertise in the right places. We must attack bureaucracy from the onset, refusing to “exhaust every other possibility” before stumbling upon the right policy or procedure. Our capacity to learn, adapt, and innovate is central to American Exceptionalism, and it must extend to how we govern.",

      "Raising the minimum wage to $20/hour is more than an overdue investment; it is a profound declaration of our nation’s commitment to dignity, upward mobility, and the bedrock of the middle class. We believe that labor must be venerated as the fundamental engine of prosperity, for it is through the strength and stability of our working families that our greatest economic expansion will occur. We understand the immediate pressures this crucial investment may place on America’s smallest businesses, especially those in local service industries operating with thin profit margins. That's why we’re proposing a strategic, time-limited 5-year Wage Support Tax Credit (WSTC) to enable these vital small employers to adjust seamlessly preserving job quality and economic momentum as we transition to a new model of shared abundance. This is about making a larger pie, ensuring nobody is left behind.",

      "For too long, America’s tax code has been fundamentally unfair. It has consistently favored wealth over work, allowing those who make money from money to pay disproportionately lower rates, while the hard-earned wages of our working and middle-class families are taxed far more heavily. This imbalance strikes at the very heart of the American Dream: the belief that hard work, not inherited wealth or financial maneuvering, should be the true path to prosperity. This distortion has led to a startling reality: billionaires often pay effective tax rates as low as 1%, while everyday New Yorkers–the teachers, the truck drivers, the nurses, the small business owners–pay considerably higher on their paychecks. It’s time to restore true fairness and ensure that labor is not just respected, but actively venerated and rewarded in our economy.

From the soaring anthems of Billy Joel and Alicia Keys to the poetry of Bob Dylan and Nas, or the smoothness of Tony Bennett, New York has always echoed the voice of the people—raw, real, and resilient. And in our politics, we have been a state of contrasts and greatness: producing a Mario Cuomo and a Donald Trump, two sons of New York who stand on opposite ideological poles but each made their mark on the national stage. Their stories—so different, yet so definitively New York—are reminders that this state breeds visionaries. It also teaches us that strength lies in contrast, and greatness in synthesis.",
